I'm a software developer with a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly applications. I have a strong background in web development and a keen eye for detail. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.</p>\r\n    <p>My journey in software development began with a deep love for coding and a desire to create something meaningful. I started with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gradually delved into more complex technologies like React, Node.js, and Python. I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of building scalable and efficient applications that can make a positive impact on people's lives.</p>\r\n    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hobbies or spending time with loved ones. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see where my journey takes me.</p>             \r\n    <p></p>\r\n    <p></p>\r\n    <p></p>\r\n    <p></p> \r\n    <p></p>\r\n    <p></p>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'about-page'\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n#about {\r\n  padding: 2rem;\r\n  color: white;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n</style>"],"mappings":"AAiBA,eAAe;EACbA,IAAI,EAAE;AACR","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
